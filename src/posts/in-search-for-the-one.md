## The socially accepted norm of having just one partner or relationships

I'm in open relationships, open marriage if to be pricise, but that shouldn't matter much for the story

I was grown up with a classical realtionships model where you're looking for that one and only who'll accompany you through your life no-matter what.

Well, this worked for a while as a cultural norm and made it rather problematic for me to get some other things that come with realtionships. Like good sex for example.
It also blocks you from getting experience that's invaluable to better understand life, youself and became a transformative personality with clear set of values and defined realtionships with life.

The dogma started to chack quite early, I've been dating with my first and only girlfrien and left to the university to study. There I saw a lady that I, as I then though, fell in love with.
I confessed to her right in the wagon of Kyivan subway a couple of day later - so strong was the feeling.

Than it was a chaos and turmoil of being in love here in there. Maintaining secrecy, having to lie, etc.


## Later I met my wife

## Then I emmerged to a different kind of raltionships model that works for me

- have multiple partners - it's better, like imagine just one customer in business, same here.
- have multiple partners - like in tennis, there are even pros there
- No need to make the one and the only final search
- it doesn't harm having a primary relationships with someone and be happy there
