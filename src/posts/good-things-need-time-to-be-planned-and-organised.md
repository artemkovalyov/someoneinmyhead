Good things happen when they are cared of and organized. That is often why we need our time back from work or other non-sensical activities
Times is valuable if you know how to spend it on what you indeed value.
Try for once think of a nice route for a walk or cook with proper ingredients fetched. You'll see how the most joyful subtle details need you time and bring the most joy
I notices we somehow often expect good thing to be there for us without effort, like an icecream or another quick delight. But if you're looking for a greatly tasting gelatto or for a quality time you'll need time to try, research and appreciated it.
Interestingly, most of the time the time is taken from us and organising our joy feels least important and something to easily skip. It's gonna be Ok by itself, it's a leasure at the end of the day.
This is where we get into a viscious loop of cutting time desitned for getting experiences and rarely enjoying those we have because of being disconnected.

Of course there are tons of factors influencing our feelings and perception, but I reckon not paying time and a courtesy of preparation is one of the biggest impacting.
Ask any hobby man how important it is to get things right for their favorite activity they are devoted with.

I myself found that to get fun out of many things cutting corners just doesn't work, you can't succeed in you favorite sport is you hope to push through, you can't fully enjoy wine if you don't know how to taste it, you can't ....
Although seeming obvious taking this step is far from easy. There's always something on the way of the pleasur to fully commit to a pleasure.

If you feel butterflies for something, try giving it the time it deserves to flavour you the life with depth and breadth instead of jumping stones.

That is where I often get on the brink of getting angry after another workaholic, start up founder, investor or your colleague bored with own life outside of work starts to preach that what you do for work is life.
For some it could be, for majority it is NOT. Be mindful, don't let this stereotype steal the most prescious of our resources.
