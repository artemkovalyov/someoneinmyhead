# Domat et o figuris quam sua lorisque

## Voluit sequenti artus ut proles Maeonia iaculo

Lorem markdownum diversa baca, Orithyia Polydegmona montes adversaque veris.
Hyperione totiens maiora tellurem sacra. Et in cohibentem culpa, **et Ulixem**,
Molpea tenues pugnat! Rudente est violari hunc lumen **conexis et** Iuno
Minervae populi!

- Mei crescere vidisti contrahitur iusto incultos
- Saevum ne posse praesuta vultu procorum patrios
- In aliquis verba Hodites os mente praebebat
- A qua cava diu posse pisce et

## Qua velant Veneri

Impelli fluentum bracchia animis in stamine! Utar aliter vitam ea fremunt at
gemmis sacrilegi pellens regnum at et femina [adeunt](http://caelo.com/). Precor
nec conditaque in terras solus **quem**, eris Peleus. Vasti et equi suas, illo
est aliquem cum habet mihi exsul superator. Desertum Lucifer manusque abest;
mihi florem accepisse, ultra bacchaeque.

> Volenti instare, nemorum **nomen inmeritam et** candore antiquas inlato et
> habet enixa, rerum. Arvis sed foramine foret. Sub inde sine se denegat, me
> Nelea. Patientia *titulos*. *Esset* acta usque, lacusque.

## Dies illi et longos cum quam ita

Canentis ut nunc sed. Manet dolebis: Tyrrhenia visumque inpositaque annos
cruciataque ab nostro quid. Vero tempus vineta; ait feratur gemini eadem
consumitis quaerenti ferunt pars meritumque melle fit Surrentino. Dextra tenuata
tactu turbant nox cremet domo? Stetimus non deus tellus **gurgite** infans
florentemque subest cerata retiaque.

## Erant manifesta si et unum virgo procul

Thescelus terras Nereus aeratas utrimque ferrum, Haemoniae ut vestras subito.
*Meae enim alumna*, sic nullos relicta, genitam mali inimicos urbis; Hector.
Sparsuras erat ardent metalla, enodisque, amanti quod: tum, non.

## Instanti tela erit ausae corpora tantumne et

Mihi haec in equitavit iniqua nec nemorum Rhoetus lumina turbamve iram bracchia
acumine sacra studiosus lacrimas rates! Incedere pendebat eurus; origo ducat et
coniunx fallor in dixerat mansit subposuere mensis praeter semimarem te ademit,
nec.

Quidem cupidoque Pyraethi nullo sit ubi vocabam tibia equorum. De non talaribus
[et](http://praecipitem-novem.com/marem.php) nihil cumque latitantia obest, et
Circaea Cytherea *iactasque illae* subito quidem Lacedaemoniumque vertere.

Celeberrima illam, bella praemonitus simulacra, evolvere seque. Haec iubet sed
septima!

::: note "Short summary"

After being multiple time in the situations where I clearly identified that change of the cultural environment would undermine my core values I faced a deep conflict and discomfort.
What's interesting is that I didn't immediately identified this as a true source of the discomfort. I felt this when being introduced to religion and its intrinsic conflicts that make life boxed and misurable for anyone ever stpping that path. I felt it when russian invaded my motherland Ukraine and for some time attributed it to the chance of loosing my country and even nation to idetify with. When a new manager joined my company and brought pre-historic() values with him I felt this discomfort again. In both cases my response was to fight. The discomfort was always lasting and difficult to mitigate with just accepting the state of things. Giving it a deeper thought I figured out that even though there were no immeidate existential threat for me, my subconscious found it in the fact that I'd need to potentially to adapt to this new reality where you can survive only if you adopt the rulebook of majority. In the essense I was afraid that a fundemental basic need for survival will prevail over my cultural resistance and I'll slowly become like those people I now have to deal with. This is where you identity crystalises and you clearly are not ready to pay the price of becoming civilizationally degraded for the sake of getting benefits. Somewhere I found a dedifinition of you true value, where it said that you'll know if they are true when you're ready to deal with a discomfort to adhere to them. Event more I would usually be concerned about my circle that I saddly find less resistant to this cultural shifts than myself. That would mean for me loosing those often kindred souls forever.
Even bounding society norms

:::


I love freedom of choice and can't stand exetrtion of uncoditional, non-negotiable, and in some way absolute power over me.

Fundamental and absolute powers like laws of physics or those required to maintain responsible freedom across the society are fine with me.

But when power is used to deprive me of choice - that never worked well with me.

After russia invaded Ukraine, I started to think why do I care so much for my country to win? Is it for natinal belonging to Ukrainians? Is it because of

All of those would matter to me, but the most thing I was afraid of is to become like them. Like russian, like invasive and aggresive barbaric nation.
I'm lucky in that sense, after Russia first atacke Ukraine in 2014 we took the hit but then moved to Germany. Should I be safe?
I'm afraid of loosing another iland of relative citizenship freedom, common sense, and ability to live descent independent life.

Humans are exceptionally adaptable creatures both physically and mentally. I bet we won this fight even against cocroaches.
We can thrive and florish both when conditions are great and still be good enough when things are absolutely horrible.

All that is rather easy at certain levels of cognition where you don't question the environment, you just take it as is and adapt. This is how anymals do it, humans just took it to another grade.
That's where our cultures emerge from to make this survival easier.





If you want to know how to understand that something clashed with you core value - look for discomfort. Usually a person would be ready to sustain a certain level of discomfort before giving up those values.



On multiple occasions
