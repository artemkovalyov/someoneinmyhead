I have a lot of russian meat, obedient and silent
I use it how I see fit, they always reconcile it
Long time forgotten own voice, they all succumbed to power
Disgrace is their own choice, I rule (them) from the ivory tower.

This time Ukraine is my whim, I pay whatever price
Life is no value in my scheme, I want to roll the dice.
There is no chance I will retreat, my nukes are no joke
I'm sending lots of russian meat, for enemy to choke.

You call them soldiers in front lines, I call them - meat for fight.
They can commit whatever crimes, I claim this to be right.
They can not choose their own fate, unless it is fate to die.
I'll shoot all those who escape, they must not even try.

Warfare is a simple gig when you are a major force.
We take Ukraine in one kick, they meet us with open doors.
Attack, attack, I give an order. Russian meat in a single strike
Assaults all the Ukrainian borders, to pleasure one's lilliputian (narrow) mind.

A bloody smile on the awry face would not remain (persist for) long
Ukraine broke dictator's case, the resistance is fiercely strong.
At the cost of multiple lives, often taking the best of us
We dismantle imperial lies, and convert russian meat to dust.

We suffer, we cry, we pray, we die, we will never stop to fight
We take back own soil and sky with Ukrainian courage and might
We survive, we endure, we donate, we defy, we put everything on the plate
We inspire free world to ally, that's what enemy miscalculate.

In disgrace, with the failed feat, russian meat will return to base
Who has not rotted on the field, going to spit in dictator's face
russina meat is not of the smartest kine, they can easily go rogue

Those who will retreat,
will mince russian meat that doesn't want to retreat
It gets home and commit another

No one defeats the russian meat
We always have reserve
