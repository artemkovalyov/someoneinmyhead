Since my early days in university I've seen how you can gain visibility by bringing the problems in.
If you were to understand the material and need no help - you're invisible to the teacher.
On the other hand if you bring every even idiotic question to the teacher it almost guaranteed you a 'B' on the exams.

Later coming to the work life I've seen this pattern spread and flourish when people knowing all the problems thought of them selves like of gods.
The can always come at tell you what and why doesn't work, the wouldn't share a word how to solve it. But they would always make sure so that you know how their life is missserable from having to deal with all of that.

The roots of this behavior are probably in the childhood when you indeed bring mostly problems for someone to solve. But reasonable is not to say rational grown ups should behave defferently? Don't be so fast.

Managers like this useful idiots, they will

This is an indicator of seniority level. Saving someone with problems you feel like you've done something today. We do not appreciate enough those who are not the trouble makers.

Maybe we just haven't seen many example so those?
