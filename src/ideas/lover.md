# Love worst secret or the darkest truth about love

I think some people don't understand how positive this video is...

1. You'll never find the RIGHT person.
   This most likely means the perfect ideal person in one's head.
2. You'll never be understood.
   This most reasonably means someone else cannot understand you like you can.
3. Therefore the ideal "telepathic" love is an illusion.
   Because someone who is perfect in your head AND can have access to your mind/memories does not exist. This is talking about the stereotypical movie fantasy love in which couples are the perfect ideal for one another and can read their mind 100%.

This means that:

1. There is something WRONG with everyone.
   Because we break the ideal person and we vary in our personality, skills and physical appearance. One person that fits the perfect ideal AND can read minds is very very unlikely to exist. We're all too diverse to satisfy someone exactly. This doesn't mean there aren't people that can build trust and learn how to care for one another. This point warns us not to look for perfection, but to look for growth.

2. This also calls for growth. One needs to learn how to take care (therefore understand as much as possible) other people. Someone cannot understand you 100%; you cannot understand someone 100%. This calls for not perfection, but growth in communication.

3. Therefore the perfectionism in love is an illusion. All we can do is learn how to care for one another to make this existencial loneliness less lonely.
